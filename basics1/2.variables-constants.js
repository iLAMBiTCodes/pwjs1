// Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
// Variable names cannot contain spaces.
// Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const.
// By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
// Variables should be given descriptive names that indicate their content and usage (e.g. sellingPrice and costPrice rather than x and y).
// As JavaScript variables do not have set types, it can be useful to include an indication of the type in the name (e.g. orderNumber is obviously a numeric ID, whereas order could be an object, a string or anything else).
